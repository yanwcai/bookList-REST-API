# About
This is a booklist management REST API, along with a web interface created using Javascript.

# Run the API
In terminal: node app.js / npm start

# Dataset and database 
The booklist dataset is obtained from Kaggle "Books Dataset" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbagchi/books-dataset)
The dataset is imported to Postgresql, and this API will be interacting with Postgresql.

# TODO
API testing scripts will be added to automate the testing process
(and integrate to GitHub CI/CD)
Setup a schema (for easier book insertion)
